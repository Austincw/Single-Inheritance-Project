# Single-Inheritance-Project
Created by Austin Washington and Zachary Solomon 

COMP 360 Project #2 Description


# Objective

An onject-oriented programming language supports abstraction,encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.  Inheritance is a means for incrementally building new types from an existing parent type by inheriting, modifying, or adding to both the existing components and operations of the parent type.  Inheritance greatly supports reuse in the software development process.  Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) is another technique that provides a friendly environment for users.  Students will practice these techniques in this project

# Project Assignment

Design and implement an Employee Payment System using single inheritance.  This sytem will support three types of employees that are technician, engineer, and manager.  An employee has basic information such as last name, first name, address, telephone number, and social security number.  Basic operations include set month payment rate, calculate annual salary and actual payment.  Tax is deducted at 20% of total payment,  The ocmpanyallows a technician to work overtime.  Related information should include overtime hours and overtime pay rate.  If an engineer develops a new product that makes profit, he/she will receive $10,000 bonus.  If a manager does an excellent job, the company will give the manager additional 3% of his/her salary as a bonus.  An interfaceshould be developed to allow a user to input required informatino and display output informaiton.  

Your team project must satisfy the following requirements:
* A Graphic User Interface must be displayed to allow a user to input required informawtionand display the results.
* If a user requests annual payment information the person's last name, first name, address, telephone number, total tax, and total payment should be displayed.  For a technician, an engineer and a manager additional information should also be displayed, such as overtime payment, total bonus payment.
* Single inheritance must be used to demonstrate the concept of inheritance.

# Requirements

* This is a two person team project.
* The team should use department programming standard.
* The program must execute correctly.

# Changes

Some tasks that were required are now changed after clarificartion form the professor, such as only one display button to show everyting while still only showing specific information for a particular employee.
